I like going to restaurants at the weekend very much. It’s a splendid opportunity to rest from day-to-day cares and just relax. Before setting off for a restaurant, I necessarily reserve (book) a table for me not to wait to be seated. If I go there on my own, I make a reservation for one person. If my friends come along with me, then I book a table for two or more people.
In my city there different kinds of restaurants – Indian, French, Chinese and so on. I prefer oriental cuisine, so I can often be found in Japanese restaurants. Probably everyone is aware of the most signature dish of the Japanese – there’s no doubt that it is sushi. Most of my comrades don’t like sushi and when I’m going to make my way definitely for a Japanese restaurant, they refuse to go there with me.
Nevertheless, I don’t get upset and don’t give myself up to despair because of loneliness. On the contrary – I get a chance to sit in silence for a while, listen to oriental music and taste “one of the specials”.
Waiters in the Japanese restaurant are very obliging. At the beginning they hand me the menu for 10-15 minutes so that I might study it well. I adore sweets, therefore I always order some dessert. A waiter takes my order and after a while he serves me the dessert. At the end I pay for the dinner and leave some tip.
